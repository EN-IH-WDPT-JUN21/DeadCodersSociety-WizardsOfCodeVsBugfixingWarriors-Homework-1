We stand united!
Eternally great!
The god of death demands its pay!
Take what is ours!
Remove them from this Earth!
Burn!
Glory to us all!
For the light!
Time for a warm up!
Take no prisoners!
We reign forever!
Leave none alive!
Die!
Freedom!
We stand together!
Once more!
That one is mine!
Destroy everything!
Forever unbroken!
Bring me their heads!
Death can wait no longer!
Here we come!
Let's go!
Kneel before our lord!
Cut them down!
We never tire!
Time to pay!
Let the crows feast tonight!
Feel our might!
Bring them to their knees!
Swift and savage!
Obliterate them from history!
In god's name!
By our blades you shall perish!
Death to the enemy!
Death and glory!
Cower before us!
Make them fear our name!
Let them taste our blades!
Feed them to the maggots!
We are the greatest!
Forever as one!
For our people!
We ride forever!
Witness our might!
Our blades hunger!
Bring me their teeth!
Our time is now!
Take everything!
We are the reapers!
Paint the fields in their blood!
We will never stop!
It's feeding time!
Let them meet their maker!
Chaos and anarchy!
Wipe them from history!
Let them meet our best!
Trample them beneath your feet!
We shall conquer all!
Let's get to know who they are on the inside!
For king and country!
Behold our power!
Send them to their maker!
Let's teach them how it's done!
We shall be remembered!
For chaos!
Leave them with nothing!
Take them down!
Our life for god!
Come and get us!
Tear them to pieces!
We will be victorious!
Death to the weak!
Our time has come!
Destroy them all!
Spit on their corpses!
Bring it on!
By our blade!
Bathe in their blood!
Prepare for destruction!
To glory!
Blood for the blood god!
Fill them with regret!
We have risen!
Until eternity!
We have arrived!
Destroy everything in your path!
Fertilize these lands with their corpses!
as one!
Leave only ashes!
you're already dead!
Bring me their guts!
Tear them down!
For justice!
Charge!
Praise the people!
